I'm a passionate psychology and AI student with a growing interest in cognitive science and computer vision. 
I enjoy building projects in C++ and Python, especially those that combine theory with practical applications. 
Currently, I'm working on research related to doomscrolling's effects on attention and comprehension using computer vision techniques. 
This portfolio showcases my journey in programming and scientific inquiry as I continue learning and exploring new ideas.
